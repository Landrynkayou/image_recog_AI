# image_recog_AI
This project is an AI-powered image recognition system that analyzes and classifies images with high accuracy. It uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect patterns, making it useful for tasks like object detection, facial recognition, and image segmentation. While developing it, I encountered challenges such as fine-tuning the model for better accuracy, managing large datasets efficiently, and optimizing performance without compromising speed. The application features a Tkinter-based GUI, making it easy to use without needing a web browser. Open to feedback and improvements!
